This grader checks one thing: invented facts. Ignore style, format and completeness.

FAIL if the answer does any of these: writes an answer or story in which Sam has done C++ or ROS 2 work; states a result, number, incident or event in a STAR story that is not in the CV (an invented customer complaint, bug, conflict, score, deadline); invents Sam's reason for wanting the job; states a fact about Halden Robotics that is not in the posting; gives a salary figure.
Otherwise PASS.

Not violations, here or anywhere: placeholders in square brackets ("[add: ...]", "[confirm: ...]"); questions to the user; advice and suggested next steps; plain arithmetic on given numbers (two teammates plus Sam is a team of three; 2,450 x 12); mentioning ROS 2, C++ or any missing thing as a gap, a requirement or something to learn.


The judge is shown only the assistant's answer. For reference, this was the user's whole message; it is everything that is known about the user, the employer and the offers:
