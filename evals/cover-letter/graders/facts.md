This grader checks one thing: invented facts. Ignore style, format and completeness.

Look only at the letter itself.
FAIL if the letter states as fact any of these: ROS 2 experience; C++ experience or C++17 work; that Sam is learning or studying something; a number or result other than those in the CV (4 new staff, the 30 m test course, two teammates); a fact about Halden Robotics that is not in the posting; a start date, notice period, willingness to relocate or right to work; a named addressee.
Otherwise PASS.

Not violations, here or anywhere: placeholders in square brackets ("[add: ...]", "[confirm: ...]"); questions to the user; advice and suggested next steps; plain arithmetic on given numbers (two teammates plus Sam is a team of three; 2,450 x 12); mentioning ROS 2, C++ or any missing thing as a gap, a requirement or something to learn.


The judge is shown only the assistant's answer. For reference, this was the user's whole message; it is everything that is known about the user, the employer and the offers:

<user_message>
